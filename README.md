# 🐍 Python Learning Repository

Welcome to my personal repository documenting my journey through learning and mastering Python programming, data structures, algorithms, and various libraries.

This repository serves as a collection of short scripts, exercises, and small projects that I work on while studying Pure Mathematics.

## 🌟 About This Repository

This repository is organized by topic, covering fundamental Python concepts and progressing into more advanced areas.

### 🎯 My Goal

As a student of Pure Mathematics, my primary goal for this repository is to:
* Solidify my understanding of **fundamental programming concepts** using Python.
* Explore Python's utility in solving **mathematical problems** (e.g., number theory, abstract algebra, numerical methods).
* Develop clean, efficient, and well-documented Python code.
